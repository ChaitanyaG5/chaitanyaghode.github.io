## 👋 About Me
I’m a motivated Information Technology student with a strong foundation in **C, Java, and Python**, and hands-on experience in **data analysis** and **computer vision**. I enjoy solving problems, writing clean code, and applying core concepts to real-world projects.

I have worked with **NumPy and Pandas** for data handling and analysis, and developed **OpenCV-based computer vision projects**, exploring image processing and real-time vision techniques. I’m continuously learning and improving my skills in software development and emerging technologies.
